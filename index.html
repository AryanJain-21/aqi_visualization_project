        <h1>Investigating the Evolution of Air Quality Across U.S. States from 1980 to 2024</h1>

        <h3>Overall Introduction</h3>
    
        <p>Air quality is a critical factor in ensuring the health of both the environment and society. The Air Quality Index (AQI) 
            provides a standardized measure of pollution levels, indicating whether the air is safe to breathe or poses health risks. 
            By analyzing AQI trends over time, we can assess the effectiveness of environmental policies, understand the impact of 
            urbanization and industrial activities, and identify regions that require more targeted intervention to improve air quality.
        </p>
        
        <p> A high AQI indicates poor air quality, which can lead to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, reduced visibility, 
            and environmental degradation. A low AQI reflects cleaner air, supporting better health outcomes, economic productivity, 
            and ecological stability.</p>

        <p>Air quality is shaped by many factors, including traffic emissions, industrial operations, natural events, 
            and the enforcement of pollution control measures. Examining AQI data over several decades allows us to uncover patterns, 
            highlight regions that have successfully reduced pollution, and understand where further efforts are needed to ensure 
            a healthier environment for all.</p>

        <p>This analysis explores AQI trends across the United States over time, examining regional, seasonal, and categorical patterns. 
            Additionally, we investigate correlations with weather factors and population data.</p>
    
        <p>To explore more about air quality and its implications, 
            you can visit the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)</a> or access 
            interactive resources like <a href="https://www.airnow.gov/">Airnow</a>.</p>

        <h3>Introduction to the data</h3>
        
        <h4>AQI Dataset From the Environmental Protection Agency</h4>

        <p>The main dataset for this project is obtained from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Air Quality System (AQS) Data Mart, specifically focusing on Daily Air Quality Index (AQI) data. 
            On the EPA website, the data is organized by year and into separate .csv files. 
            We downloaded each file, read the data with pandas, and combined all the data for each year.
             The data is available for download <a href="https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html#AQI" target="_blank">here</a>.
        </p> 

        <p>The dataset is comprehensive, with hundreds of thousands of entries per year for each county. 
            Our entire dataset from 1980 to 2024 includes 11,419,415 rows and 10 attributes.
            To efficiently analyze trends over time, we grouped the data into meaningful intervals, such as seasonal averages, yearly averages, and regional summaries. 
            This allowed us to reduce the complexity of the data while preserving critical patterns and insights. 
            By focusing on aggregated portions of the data, such as the average AQI by year or season for each region, 
            we were able to identify long-term trends without being overwhelmed by the raw data's size and detail.</p>

            <h4>Population Dataset From the United States Census Bureau</h4>
            <p>To understand how population dynamics correlate with AQI changes, we incorporated population data from the United States Census Bureau. 
                The population dataset includes population estimates for each state and region from 1910 to 2020, with a census being conducted once every 10 years. 
                This dataset contains a total of 684 rows and 10 attributes, offering a comprehensive view of population trends over more than a century. 
                The data is available for download <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/dec/density-data-text.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
            </p>
            
            <p>This dataset allows us to analyze trends in AQI relative to population growth. 
                By combining these two datasets, we can investigate how factors like population density and urbanization might impact air quality over time. 
                For example, we explore whether states with significant population growth experienced corresponding changes in AQI and whether improvements in air quality were consistent across regions with varying population trends.

                The bubble charts examine the relationship between the average number of monitoring 
                sites in each state and the corresponding AQI values for 1980 and 2021. The size of 
                each bubble represents the total number of data points for that state, providing 
                insight into the extent of monitoring coverage. The 1980 chart shows a sparse 
                distribution of monitoring sites and higher AQI values in many states, while the 2021 
                chart reflects a more extensive monitoring network and improved AQI levels for many 
                states. These visualizations are critical for assessing the impact of monitoring 
                infrastructure on air quality management, helping to identify states that may need 
                expanded monitoring efforts to better track and address air quality concerns.

<p>This visualization illustrates the trends in Air Quality Index (AQI) across U.S. regions during different seasons for 1980 
    and 2023, highlighting significant improvements in air quality over time. The Northeast, which exhibited the highest AQI
     levels in 1980—particularly during summer—saw notable reductions by 2023, reflecting the success of environmental policies 
     and emission controls. Seasonal patterns show that summer consistently experiences the highest AQI due to increased ozone 
     formation from heat and sunlight, while winter exhibits the lowest levels. Regional differences persist, with the West
      showing substantial improvement, particularly during summer and fall, likely due to better wildfire management and 
      pollution control efforts. Overall, the visualization underscores the effectiveness of decades of regulatory measures
       while emphasizing the need for continued focus on seasonal pollution and regional disparities to ensure sustained 
       progress in air quality.</p>

        <h3>Compare Population Density and AQI</h3>

            <iframe src="aqi_population_scatter_plot.html" width="95%" height="550px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        </div>

        <h4>User Interaction:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Hover over each point to see the state name, population density, AQI value, year and region.</li>
            <li>Drag the slider to select different years between 1980 and 2020.</li>
            <li>Click on the radio buttons to filter by region or select all regions.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This scatter plot illustrates the relationship between population density and the Air Quality Index (AQI) for U.S. states between 1980 and 2020. 
            Each point represents a state, color-coded by its region (Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New England, South, or West), with population density on the x-axis and AQI on the y-axis.
        </p>
        <p>
            Between 1980 and 2020, this scatter plot highlights significant improvements in air quality across U.S. states while maintaining the relationship between population density and the Air Quality Index (AQI). 
            In 1980, states with lower population densities, particularly in the Midwest and South, exhibited a wide range of AQI values, with some states having significantly high AQI levels. This underscores how industrial activities, regional pollution sources, and a lack of stringent environmental regulations heavily influenced air quality in less populated areas. 
            Meanwhile, urbanized regions like New England and the Mid-Atlantic displayed relatively lower AQI values, reflecting the early adoption of pollution control measures and infrastructure investments in densely populated areas.
        </p> 
        <p>
            By 2020, the data reveals a consistent downward shift in AQI values across all regions. 
            The average AQI dropped from 51 in 1980 to 40 in 2020, which can be attributed to decades of regulatory efforts, including the Clean Air Act, advancements in emissions technology, and better enforcement of environmental standards. 
            Regions with high population densities have further improved their air quality, solidifying the link between urbanization, infrastructure investment, and effective air quality management. For example, Connecticut had the worst recorded AQI in 1980 at 86, but it drastically improved to an AQI of 43 in 2020. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Based on the data, we can conclude that although population density may play a factor in worse AQI, other factors, 
            such as industrial activity, regional pollution sources, and the effectiveness of environmental regulations, can significantly influence AQI values.

        <h3>Summary and Additional Work</h3>

        <p>
            This analysis of Air Quality Index trends across the United States highlights the progress made to improve
             air quality over the decades, along with the continued challenges in certain regions and seasons. Notable 
             improvements in AQI levels have been realized, with the Northeast and West registering the most improvements 
             due to the success of environmental regulations such as the Clean Air Act and technological enhancements to 
             pollution controls. However, seasonal trends indicate that summer months are still posting high AQI levels 
             because of increased ozone formation during the period due to increased temperature and sunlight exposure.
        </p>
        <p>
            The results again underscore the need for proactive monitoring and enforcement of pollution control. 
            Areas with extensive air quality monitoring and more stringent emission standards show better performance,
             while locations with limited monitoring infrastructure face difficulties in controlling air pollution. 
             In many places, especially the Midwest and parts of the South, regional sources like traffic emissions, 
             industrial processes, and wildfires continued to contribute to poor air quality. The data also highlights 
             weather and urbanization as major determinants of air quality; higher temperatures and stagnation episodes 
             increase pollution levels.
        </p>
        <p>
            A number of activities will help ensure that these air quality improvements are sustained and continue well into the future.
             Furthermore, deeper regulation and investment in greener technologies are needed if pollution levels are to be further 
             reduced. Expanding the air quality monitoring infrastructure across more rural and underserved areas will ensure more 
             complete data collection and targeted interventions. In addition, a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and increased 
             urban greenery will help to combat the impacts of rising temperatures on ozone and particulate matter levels.
        </p>

        <p> 
            By prioritizing air quality monitoring and policy intervention, the United States will continue to protect public 
            health and promote environmental sustainability for future generations.
            In the future, we plan to explore the relationship between air quality and health outcomes, 
            including respiratory diseases and cardiovascular conditions. We will also investigate the 
            impact of air quality on economic productivity and environmental sustainability. By integrating 
            additional datasets on health, economic, and environmental indicators, we aim to provide a more 
            comprehensive analysis of the implications of air quality on society and the environment.

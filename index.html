            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Air Quality Index (AQI) provides a measure of air pollution levels and their potential health effects. 
               This analysis explores AQI trends across the United States over time, examining regional, seasonal, and categorical patterns. 
               Additionally, we investigate correlations with weather factors and population data.</p>

                    <p> These stacked bar charts compare the distribution of AQI categories 
                        (e.g., Good, Moderate, Unhealthy) across major U.S. regions in 1980 and 2021. 
                        Each region is displayed as a separate bar, with segments showing the proportion of 
                        days falling into each AQI category. The 1980 chart highlights regions struggling 
                        with higher proportions of "Unhealthy" and "Very Unhealthy" days, whereas the 2021 
                        chart reveals a significant shift toward more "Good" and "Moderate" AQI days in many regions. 
                        This side-by-side comparison underscores the regional disparities in air quality improvement 
                        over time and helps pinpoint areas still facing persistent pollution challenges. 
                        It is a crucial tool for evaluating the success of regional policies and environmental 
                        management efforts.

                    <p> This chart illustrates the AQI trends over time for the five most polluted states and the 
                        five least polluted states, based on data from 1980 and 2021. The top 5 states are 
                        represented with solid lines, showing significant reductions in AQI for most of these states,
                         reflecting progress in combating air pollution. The bottom 5 states are shown with 
                         dashed lines, emphasizing their consistently low AQI levels across both years. 
                         This visualization provides insights into the effectiveness of air quality 
                         improvement measures over time, highlighting states that have made substantial 
                         progress and those that maintain clean air standards. Policymakers and researchers 
                         can leverage this data to identify successful strategies and areas requiring further 
                         intervention.

                        The bubble charts examine the relationship between the average number of 
                        monitoring sites in each state and the corresponding AQI values for 1980 
                        and 2021. The size of each bubble represents the total number of data points
                         for that state, providing insight into the extent of monitoring coverage. 
                         The 1980 chart shows a sparse distribution of monitoring sites and higher 
                         AQI values in many states, while the 2021 chart reflects a more extensive
                          monitoring network and improved AQI levels for many states. 
                          These visualizations are critical for assessing the impact of 
                          monitoring infrastructure on air quality management, helping to identify
                           states that may need expanded monitoring efforts to better track and 
                           address air quality concerns.

                <p>The 1980 AQI Heatmap, as shown below, displays that in many parts of the county, 
                    the average AQI was significantly high, particularly in the Northeast.</p>

                <p>The 2024 AQI heatmap, as shown below, on the contrary has a very noticeable improvement 
                    in average AQI throughout the country. It is clear that the Clean Air Act, other regulations, 
                    and the lockdown in 2021 had a very noticeable improvement in air quality. Especially in regions 
                    like the Northeast and some of the South. This correlates with a study showing that the top 
                    three biggest decreases in air pollution during lockdown in America happened in Washington DC 
                    with -21.1%, New York with -20.7%, and Boston with -18.5%</p>

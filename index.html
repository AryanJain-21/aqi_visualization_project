        <h1> US AQI analysis over Time</h1>

        <h3>Overall Introduction</h3>
    
        <p>The Air Quality Index (AQI) provides a measure of air pollution levels and their potential health effects. 
            This analysis explores AQI trends across the United States over time, examining regional, seasonal, and categorical patterns. 
            Additionally, we investigate correlations with weather factors and population data.</p>
    
        <p>Monitoring the unemployment rate provides insights into 
            various aspects of the economy, such as consumer spending,
             business confidence, and government policies' effectiveness.
            A high unemployment rate may indicate economic downturns, 
            leading to decreased consumer spending, reduced business 
            investments, and potential social unrest. Conversely, 
            a low unemployment rate signifies a robust economy with 
            ample job opportunities, contributing to higher consumer 
            confidence and economic growth.</p>
    
        <p>Several social factors are closely related to the unemployment
             rate. Persistent unemployment can lead to financial hardships,
              increased poverty rates, and reduced access to essential 
              services, such as healthcare and education. Moreover, 
              unemployment may exacerbate existing social inequalities, 
              disproportionately affecting marginalized communities, 
              including minorities, youth, and individuals with lower 
              educational attainment.</p>
    
        <p>To learn more about the US unemployment rate and its implications,
             you can visit the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/">Bureau of Labor Statistics website</a> or explore 
             analysis reports from reputable research organizations like 
             <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/">Pew Research Center</a>.</p>

        <h3>Introduction to the data</h3>

        <p> Our analysis makes use of two datasets. the first data is 
            a data set called `us_statewide_crime.csv` which contains 
            the following crime statistics for all US states and the 
            District of Columbia in 2010. The data has 50 rows with 9 
            features. The detail information about the features are listed
            in the following table:</p>  
    
            <div class="center">
            <table class="tg">
                <thead>

                  </tr>
                </thead>

                  </tr>
                  <tr>

                    <td class="tg-0lax">Murder rate (per 100,000 residents)</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>

                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td class="tg-0lax">High_School</td>
                    <td class="tg-0lax">Percent of residents with a high school degree</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td class="tg-0lax">College</td>
                    <td class="tg-0lax">Percent of residents with a four-year college degree</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td class="tg-0lax">Single_Parent</td>
                    <td class="tg-0lax">Percent of children living in single parent families</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>

                    <td class="tg-0lax">Unemployment rate</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td class="tg-0lax">Metropolitan</td>
                    <td class="tg-0lax">Percent of residents living in a metropolitan area</td>
                  </tr>
                </tbody>
                </table>
            </div>
            <p>Meanwhile, we also believe that the geographical 
                information is important when evaluating the unemployment
                rate. Therefore, we also make use of geographical information 
                on <a href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/">Natural Earth</a>. 
                The website provides the geographical information for making maps for US states. 
            </p>
    
            <p>To make a better data visualization, we remove the Alaska and Hawaii
                from the data. Following is an interactive map for the 
                lower 48 states in US. User can zoom in the map. The color
                indicates the unemployment rate for each state. When click any 
                state, other social factors will be revealed for the state. </p>

                <p>The 1980 AQI Heatmap, as shown below, displays that in many parts of the county, 
                    the average AQI was significantly high, particularly in the Northeast.</p>
    
                <div class = 'center'>
                    <iframe src="aqi_choropleth_2024.html" width="80%" height="400px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
                </div>
                <p>The 2024 AQI heatmap, as shown below, on the contrary has a very noticeable improvement 
                    in average AQI throughout the country. It is clear that the Clean Air Act, other regulations, 
                    and the lockdown in 2021 had a very noticeable improvement in air quality. Especially in regions 
                    like the Northeast and some of the South. This correlates with a study showing that the top 
                    three biggest decreases in air pollution during lockdown in America happened in Washington DC 
                    with -21.1%, New York with -20.7%, and Boston with -18.5%

                <h3>Overview of the AQI</h3>
        
        <div class="container">
            <div class="text">
                <p>These stacked bar charts compare the distribution of AQI categories 
                    (e.g., Good, Moderate, Unhealthy) across major U.S. regions in 1980 and 2021. 
                    Each region is displayed as a separate bar, with segments showing the proportion of 
                    days falling into each AQI category. The 1980 chart highlights regions struggling 
                    with higher proportions of "Unhealthy" and "Very Unhealthy" days, whereas the 2021 
                    chart reveals a significant shift toward more "Good" and "Moderate" AQI days in many regions. 
                    This side-by-side comparison underscores the regional disparities in air quality improvement 
                    over time and helps pinpoint areas still facing persistent pollution challenges. 
                    It is a crucial tool for evaluating the success of regional policies and environmental 
                    management efforts.

                    The bubble charts examine the relationship between the average number of monitoring 
                    sites in each state and the corresponding AQI values for 1980 and 2021. The size of 
                    each bubble represents the total number of data points for that state, providing 
                    insight into the extent of monitoring coverage. The 1980 chart shows a sparse 
                    distribution of monitoring sites and higher AQI values in many states, while the 2021 
                    chart reflects a more extensive monitoring network and improved AQI levels for many 
                    states. These visualizations are critical for assessing the impact of monitoring 
                    infrastructure on air quality management, helping to identify states that may need 
                    expanded monitoring efforts to better track and address air quality concerns.

        <h3> The relationship between unemployment rate and other social factors</h3>

        <div class = 'container'>
            <div class = 'text'>
                <p>Moreover, we also want to examine the relationship between
                    unemployment rate and other social factors in the data. All 
                    features are numerical thus we firts create a correlation
                    plot to examine whether there are linear relationship between 
                    unemployment rate with other social factors. Notice that if 
                    the correlation is small, it only means that there is no potential
                    linear relationship between two features. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Based on the correlation plot, among all the features, poverty 
                    has the strongest correlation with the unemployment rate since
                    they are both related to the economics. The percentage of single 
                    parents is the second important feature which inidicates the 
                    stability of family is also strongly related to the job market. 
                    The increase of unemployment rate may also related to the increase 
                    of violent crime and murder rate but has a negative relationship
                    with education indicators, like the percentage of people who go to
                    high school and college. The only variable that has no direct linear
                    relation with the unemployment rate is Metropolitan, which means the 
                    percent of residents living in a metropolitan area.

        <p> This chart illustrates the AQI trends over time for the five most polluted states and the 
            five least polluted states, based on data from 1980 and 2021. The top 5 states are 
            represented with solid lines, showing significant reductions in AQI for most of these states,
             reflecting progress in combating air pollution. The bottom 5 states are shown with 
             dashed lines, emphasizing their consistently low AQI levels across both years. 
             This visualization provides insights into the effectiveness of air quality 
             improvement measures over time, highlighting states that have made substantial 
             progress and those that maintain clean air standards. Policymakers and researchers 
             can leverage this data to identify successful strategies and areas requiring further 
             intervention.

        <h3>Summary and additional work</h3>

        <p>
            In this visualization analysis, we try to explore the US 
            unemployment rate across states. We also examine the relation
            between unemployment rate and other social factors. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, this is the 2010 data thus may be different 
            than the current economics status. Also, unemployment rate 
            may fluctuate seasonally thus adding a time series analysis
            will be more informative.

          Investigating the Evolution of Air Quality Across U.S. States from
          1980 to 2024
        </h1>

        <h3>Overall Introduction</h3>

        <p>
          Air quality is a fundamental pillar of both environmental health and
          human well-being, though its importance often goes unnoticed. The Air
          Quality Index (AQI) serves as a vital tool, offering a clear and
          standardized measure of air pollution levels. This index not only
          informs us about whether the air is safe to breathe but also acts as a
          barometer of the broader state of our environment. Through its
          insights, we can discern the effectiveness of policies, track the
          impacts of urban expansion and industrial activities, and pinpoint
          regions in need of urgent action.
        </p>

        <p>
          Poor air quality, reflected in a high AQI, brings a host of
          consequences. It exacerbates respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses,
          dims visibility, and accelerates environmental degradation. On the
          other hand, a low AQI symbolizes cleaner air, fostering better health
          outcomes, bolstering economic productivity, and supporting ecological
          balance. The story of air quality is shaped by many forces—traffic
          emissions, industrial operations, natural events like wildfires, and
          the enforcement of pollution control measures. Each plays a role in a
          complex narrative that connects human activity to environmental
          outcomes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Examining AQI trends over time allows us to uncover patterns and
          progress, offering insights into how policies and societal behaviors
          influence the air we breathe. For example, the global slowdown during
          the COVID-19 pandemic provided a rare opportunity to observe the
          profound impact of reduced human activity on air quality, with many
          regions experiencing temporary improvements. Conversely, devastating
          wildfires in recent years have underscored the fragility of air
          quality in the face of climate change, leaving lingering effects on
          health and ecosystems. By analyzing these events, we can better
          understand how external factors shape the trajectory of air quality
          and what can be done to mitigate future challenges
        </p>

        <p>
          This analysis delves into AQI trends across the United States,
          exploring regional, seasonal, and categorical patterns while drawing
          connections to weather, population shifts, and significant external
          events. Our goal is not just to examine data but to spark awareness
          and inspire action. The air we breathe is a shared resource,
          connecting us all in its embrace. By raising awareness of the factors
          influencing air quality, we hope to empower communities, policymakers,
          and individuals to work together in preserving this most essential
          element of life.

        <h3>Introduction to the data</h3>

        <h4>AQI Dataset From the Environmental Protection Agency</h4>

        <p>
          The main dataset for this project is obtained from the Environmental
          Protection Agency (EPA) Air Quality System (AQS) Data Mart,
          specifically focusing on Daily Air Quality Index (AQI) data. On the
          EPA website, the data is organized by year and into separate .csv
          files. We downloaded each file, read the data with pandas, and
          combined all the data for each year. The data is available for
          download
          <a
            href="https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html#AQI"
            target="_blank"
            >here</a
          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          The dataset is comprehensive, with hundreds of thousands of entries
          per year for each county. Our entire dataset from 1980 to 2024
          includes 11,419,415 rows and 10 attributes. To efficiently analyze
          trends over time, we grouped the data into meaningful intervals, such
          as seasonal averages, yearly averages, and regional summaries. This
          allowed us to reduce the complexity of the data while preserving
          critical patterns and insights. By focusing on aggregated portions of
          the data, such as the average AQI by year or season for each region,
          we were able to identify long-term trends without being overwhelmed by
          the raw data's size and detail.
        </p>

        <h4>Key Features of the Dataset:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Location Details:</strong> Includes the state and county
            names, along with unique codes identifying each location.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Time Dimension:</strong> Contains the specific dates when
            AQI measurements were recorded.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Pollution Metrics:</strong> Tracks AQI values and assigns
            them to categories such as "Good," "Moderate," or "Hazardous," based
            on their severity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Pollutant Details:</strong> Identifies the specific
            pollutants contributing to air quality, such as ozone
            (O<sub>3</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), carbon monoxide
            (CO), and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Monitoring Sites:</strong> Provides information on the
            number of sites reporting data and unique site identifiers.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Population Dataset From the United States Census Bureau</h4>
        <p>
          To understand how population dynamics correlate with AQI changes, we
          incorporated population data from the United States Census Bureau. The
          population dataset includes population estimates for each state and
          region from 1910 to 2020, with a census being conducted once every 10
          years. This dataset contains a total of 684 rows and 10 attributes,
          offering a comprehensive view of population trends over more than a
          century. The data is available for download
          <a
            href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/dec/density-data-text.html"
            target="_blank"
            >here</a
          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          This dataset allows us to analyze trends in AQI relative to population
          growth. By combining these two datasets, we can investigate how
          factors like population density and urbanization might impact air
          quality over time. For example, we explore whether states with
          significant population growth experienced corresponding changes in AQI
          and whether improvements in air quality were consistent across regions
          with varying population trends.
        </p>

          The 2024 AQI heatmap, as shown above, on the contrary has a very
          noticeable improvement in average AQI throughout the country. It is
          clear that the Clean Air Act, other regulations, and the lockdown in
          2021 had a very noticeable improvement in air quality. Especially in
          regions like the Northeast, West and some of the South. This
          correlates with a study showing that the top three biggest decreases
          in air pollution during lockdown in America happened in Washington DC
          with -21.1%, New York with -20.7%, and Boston with -18.5%

              These stacked bar charts compare the distribution of AQI
              categories (e.g., Good, Moderate, Unhealthy) across major U.S.
              regions in 1980 and 2021. Each region is displayed as a separate
              bar, with segments showing the proportion of days falling into
              each AQI category. The 1980 chart highlights regions struggling
              with higher proportions of "Unhealthy" and "Very Unhealthy" days,
              whereas the 2021 chart reveals a significant shift toward more
              "Good" and "Moderate" AQI days in many regions. The increase in frequency
              is the result of more monitoring sites being set up in some regions, showing
              improving infrastructure. This side-by-side

          levels due to persistent wildfires that release significant amounts of
          pollutants into the air, highlighting ongoing environmental
          challenges. On the other hand, states such as Hawaii and Washington
          often have some of the lowest AQI values, benefiting from factors like
          geographical isolation and favorable environmental conditions. An
          interesting trend is the noticeable improvement in AQI during 2020,
          coinciding with COVID-19 lockdowns, which significantly reduced
          transportation and industrial emissions. This analysis underscores the
          profound impact of external factors, like wildfires and global events,
          on air quality and the importance of continued efforts to address
          these challenges

          This visualization presents separate Air Quality Index (AQI) charts
          for each U.S. region in a 2x2 grid layout. The charts illustrate AQI
          trends across different seasons for 1980 and 2023, providing a
          detailed view of changes over time. For example, the Northeast, which
          exhibited the highest AQI levels in 1980—particularly during
          summer—saw notable reductions by 2023. This reflects the success of
          environmental policies and emission controls.
        </p>

        <p>
          Seasonal patterns consistently show that summer experiences the
          highest AQI due to increased ozone formation from heat and sunlight,
          while winter exhibits the lowest levels. The unusual spike in AQI in
          the Fall of 1980 in the West can be attributed to the Panorama Fire, a
          destructive wildfire in California. Regional differences persist, with
          the West showing substantial improvements, particularly during summer
          and fall, due to better wildfire management and pollution control
          efforts.

          This scatter plot illustrates the relationship between population
          density and the Air Quality Index (AQI) for U.S. states between 1980
          and 2020. Each point represents a state, color-coded by its region
          (Midwest, Northeast, South, or West), with population
          density on the x-axis and AQI on the y-axis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Between 1980 and 2020, this scatter plot highlights significant
          improvements in air quality across U.S. states while maintaining the
          relationship between population density and the Air Quality Index
          (AQI). In 1980, states with lower population densities, particularly
          in the Midwest and South, exhibited a wide range of AQI values, with
          some states having significantly high AQI levels. This underscores how
          industrial activities, regional pollution sources, and a lack of
          stringent environmental regulations heavily influenced air quality in
          less populated areas. Meanwhile, urbanized regions like the Northeast
           displayed relatively lower AQI values, reflecting
          the early adoption of pollution control measures and infrastructure
          investments in densely populated areas.
        </p>
        <p>
          By 2020, the data reveals a consistent downward shift in AQI values
          across all regions. The average AQI dropped from 51 in 1980 to 40 in
          2020, which can be attributed to decades of regulatory efforts,
          including the Clean Air Act, advancements in emissions technology, and
          better enforcement of environmental standards. Regions with high
          population densities have further improved their air quality,
          solidifying the link between urbanization, infrastructure investment,
          and effective air quality management. For example, Connecticut had the
          worst recorded AQI in 1980 at 86, but it drastically improved to an
          AQI of 43 in 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on the data, we can conclude that although population density
          may play a factor in worse AQI, other factors, such as industrial
          activity, regional pollution sources, and the effectiveness of
          environmental regulations, can significantly influence AQI values.

        <h3>Summary and Additional Work</h3>

        <p>
          This analysis of Air Quality Index trends across the United States
          highlights the progress made to improve air quality over the decades,
          along with the continued challenges in certain regions and seasons.
          Notable improvements in AQI levels have been realized, with the
          Northeast and West registering the most improvements due to the
          success of environmental regulations such as the Clean Air Act and
          technological enhancements to pollution controls. However, with
          climate change concerns in the future and correlations between air
          quality and health outcomes, it is essential to continue monitoring
          and addressing climate change as a whole to prevent further air
          pollution to ensure a healthier environment for all.
        </p>
        <p>
          A number of activities will help ensure that these air quality
          improvements are sustained and continue well into the future.
          Furthermore, deeper regulation and investment in greener technologies
          are needed if pollution levels are to be further reduced. Expanding
          the air quality monitoring infrastructure across more rural and
          underserved areas will ensure more complete data collection and
          targeted interventions. In addition, a reduction in greenhouse gas
          emissions and increased urban greenery will help to combat the impacts
          of rising temperatures on ozone and particulate matter levels.
        </p>

        <p>
          By prioritizing air quality monitoring and policy intervention, the
          United States will continue to protect public health and promote
          environmental sustainability for future generations. In the future, we
          plan to explore the relationship between air quality and health
          outcomes, including respiratory diseases and cardiovascular
          conditions. We will also investigate the impact of air quality on
          economic productivity and environmental sustainability. By integrating
          additional datasets on health, economic, and environmental indicators,
          we aim to provide a more comprehensive analysis of the implications of
          air quality on society and the environment.

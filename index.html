        <h1> US AQI analysis over Time</h1>

        <h3>Overall Introduction</h3>
    
        <p>Air quality is a critical factor in ensuring the health of both the environment and society. The Air Quality Index (AQI) 
            provides a standardized measure of pollution levels, indicating whether the air is safe to breathe or poses health risks. 
            By analyzing AQI trends over time, we can assess the effectiveness of environmental policies, understand the impact of 
            urbanization and industrial activities, and identify regions that require more targeted intervention to improve air quality.
        </p>
        
        <p> A high AQI indicates poor air quality, which can lead to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, reduced visibility, 
            and environmental degradation. A low AQI reflects cleaner air, supporting better health outcomes, economic productivity, 
            and ecological stability.</p>

        <p>Air quality is shaped by many factors, including traffic emissions, industrial operations, natural events, 
            and the enforcement of pollution control measures. Examining AQI data over several decades allows us to uncover patterns, 
            highlight regions that have successfully reduced pollution, and understand where further efforts are needed to ensure 
            a healthier environment for all.</p>

        <p>This analysis explores AQI trends across the United States over time, examining regional, seasonal, and categorical patterns. 
            Additionally, we investigate correlations with weather factors and population data.</p>
    
        <p>To explore more about air quality and its implications, 
            you can visit the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)</a> or access 
            interactive resources like <a href="https://www.airnow.gov/">Airnow</a>.</p>

        <h3>Introduction to the data</h3>

        <p> Our analysis makes use of two datasets. the first data is 
            a data set called `us_statewide_crime.csv` which contains 
            the following crime statistics for all US states and the 
            District of Columbia in 2010. The data has 50 rows with 9 
            features. The detail information about the features are listed
            in the following table:</p>  
    
            <div class="center">
            <table class="tg">

                  </tr>
                </tbody>
                </table>
            </div>
            <p>Meanwhile, we also believe that the geographical 
                information is important when evaluating the unemployment
                rate. Therefore, we also make use of geographical information 
                on <a href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/">Natural Earth</a>. 
                The website provides the geographical information for making maps for US states. 
            </p>
    
            <p>To make a better data visualization, we remove the Alaska and Hawaii
                from the data. Following is an interactive map for the 
                lower 48 states in US. User can zoom in the map. The color
                indicates the unemployment rate for each state. When click any 
                state, other social factors will be revealed for the state. </p>

                <p>The 1980 AQI Heatmap, as shown below, displays that in many parts of the county, 
                    the average AQI was significantly high, particularly in the Northeast.</p>

                </div>
                <p>The 2024 AQI heatmap, as shown below, on the contrary has a very noticeable improvement 
                    in average AQI throughout the country. It is clear that the Clean Air Act, other regulations, 
                    and the lockdown in 2021 had a very noticeable improvement in air quality. Especially in regions 
                    like the Northeast and some of the South. This correlates with a study showing that the top 
                    three biggest decreases in air pollution during lockdown in America happened in Washington DC 
                    with -21.1%, New York with -20.7%, and Boston with -18.5%

        <div class="container">
            <div class="text">
                <p>These stacked bar charts compare the distribution of AQI categories 
                    (e.g., Good, Moderate, Unhealthy) across major U.S. regions in 1980 and 2021. 
                    Each region is displayed as a separate bar, with segments showing the proportion of 
                    days falling into each AQI category. The 1980 chart highlights regions struggling 
                    with higher proportions of "Unhealthy" and "Very Unhealthy" days, whereas the 2021 
                    chart reveals a significant shift toward more "Good" and "Moderate" AQI days in many regions. 
                    This side-by-side comparison underscores the regional disparities in air quality improvement 
                    over time and helps pinpoint areas still facing persistent pollution challenges. 
                    It is a crucial tool for evaluating the success of regional policies and environmental 
                    management efforts.

            <p> 
                The bubble charts examine the relationship between the average number of monitoring 
                sites in each state and the corresponding AQI values for 1980 and 2021. The size of 
                each bubble represents the total number of data points for that state, providing 
                insight into the extent of monitoring coverage. The 1980 chart shows a sparse 
                distribution of monitoring sites and higher AQI values in many states, while the 2021 
                chart reflects a more extensive monitoring network and improved AQI levels for many 
                states. These visualizations are critical for assessing the impact of monitoring 
                infrastructure on air quality management, helping to identify states that may need 
                expanded monitoring efforts to better track and address air quality concerns.

        <h3>Summary and additional work</h3>

        <p>
            This analysis of Air Quality Index trends across the United States highlights the progress made to improve
             air quality over the decades, along with the continued challenges in certain regions and seasons. Notable 
             improvements in AQI levels have been realized, with the Northeast and West registering the most improvements 
             due to the success of environmental regulations such as the Clean Air Act and technological enhancements to 
             pollution controls. However, seasonal trends indicate that summer months are still posting high AQI levels 
             because of increased ozone formation during the period due to increased temperature and sunlight exposure.
        </p>
        <p>
            The results again underscore the need for proactive monitoring and enforcement of pollution control. 
            Areas with extensive air quality monitoring and more stringent emission standards show better performance,
             while locations with limited monitoring infrastructure face difficulties in controlling air pollution. 
             In many places, especially the Midwest and parts of the South, regional sources like traffic emissions, 
             industrial processes, and wildfires continued to contribute to poor air quality. The data also highlights 
             weather and urbanization as major determinants of air quality; higher temperatures and stagnation episodes 
             increase pollution levels.
        </p>
        <p>
            A number of activities will help ensure that these air quality improvements are sustained and continue well into the future.
             Furthermore, deeper regulation and investment in greener technologies are needed if pollution levels are to be further 
             reduced. Expanding the air quality monitoring infrastructure across more rural and underserved areas will ensure more 
             complete data collection and targeted interventions. In addition, a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and increased 
             urban greenery will help to combat the impacts of rising temperatures on ozone and particulate matter levels.
        </p>

        <p> 
            By prioritizing air quality monitoring and policy intervention, the United States will continue to protect public 
            health and promote environmental sustainability for future generations.
            In the future, we plan to explore the relationship between air quality and health outcomes, 
            including respiratory diseases and cardiovascular conditions. We will also investigate the 
            impact of air quality on economic productivity and environmental sustainability. By integrating 
            additional datasets on health, economic, and environmental indicators, we aim to provide a more 
            comprehensive analysis of the implications of air quality on society and the environment.

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Air Quality Index (AQI) provides a measure of air pollution levels and their potential health effects. 
               This analysis explores AQI trends across the United States over time, examining regional, seasonal, and categorical patterns. 
               Additionally, we investigate correlations with weather factors and population data.</p>

                <h3>Geospatial Patterns</h3>
                <p>The 1980 AQI Heatmap, as shown below, displays that in many parts of the county, 
                    the average AQI was significantly high, particularly in the Northeast.</p>

                </div>
                <p>The 2024 AQI heatmap, as shown below, on the contrary has a very noticeable improvement 
                    in average AQI throughout the country. It is clear that the Clean Air Act, other regulations, 
                    and the lockdown in 2021 had a very noticeable improvement in air quality. Especially in regions 
                    like the Northeast and some of the South. This correlates with a study showing that the top 
                    three biggest decreases in air pollution during lockdown in America happened in Washington DC 
                    with -21.1%, New York with -20.7%, and Boston with -18.5%</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>This analysis provides insights into air quality trends, regional disparities, and potential influencing factors. Further work could include time series analysis and exploring health impacts of AQI variations.</p>
